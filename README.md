2. **Paraphrasing**: Rephrase text in a new way while keeping the original meaning, powered by **[Pegasus](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-xsum)**.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify names, organizations, locations, and other important entities from the text using **[DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)**.

4. **Keyword Extraction**: Find important keywords from the text with **[KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT)**, using BERT-based embeddings.

5. **Synonym Finder**: Get synonyms for words in the text using **[WordNet](https://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/)**, a large lexical database of English words.
